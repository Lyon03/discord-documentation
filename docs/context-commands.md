# Context Commands

Context Commands appear in the context menu when you right click on a user or message in Discord.

## Message Commands

`bookmark` - This command allows you to bookmark a message. Becca will send you an embed in DMs with the message content, link, and details.

`report` - This command allows you to silently report a message to the server's moderation team. Becca will not mention in the channel that the command was used (except as a reply only you can see). In order for this to be available, the server managers must have enabled the reporting channel.

## User Commands

`activity` - This command allows you to see how many interactions the user has had with Becca!
