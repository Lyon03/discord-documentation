# Currency System

Our new currency system allows you to collect BeccaCoin, a virtual currency, and exchange these coins for rewards. These coins can be collected on a daily and weekly basis. They are also generated on command use. Note that these rewards require you to [join our support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com).

## Right to Modify

We reserve the right to add, remove, or modify rewards at any time, without prior notice to the users.

## No Cash Value

BeccaCoin is a virtual currency with _no cash value_, except for implied value available through the reward exchange.

## No Bots

Using automation, scripting, self-bots, or other methods to take advantage of the currency system are violations of Discord Terms of Service and we will deny any rewards obtained this way.

## Right to Refuse

The development team reserves the right to refuse any claimed reward without compensation to the user.
